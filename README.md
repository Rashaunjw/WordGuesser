# WordGuesser 
*A test-driven, cloud-deployed word-guessing game built with Sinatra.*

---

## Overview

**WordGuesser** is my take on the classic hangman-style word game.  
The goal wasn’t just to make a game — it was to **learn the SaaS development cycle** from the ground up:  
writing tests first, thinking in user stories, and deploying to the cloud like a real software engineer.

This project walked me through everything from **test-driven development (TDD)** to **Sinatra web apps** and **Heroku deployment** — all while adapting a simple command-line game into a real, browser-based SaaS.

## Learning Highlights 🧠

Here’s what this project helped me practice and internalize:

- **Building and deploying** a small SaaS app from scratch  
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** using RSpec  
- Understanding how frameworks like **Sinatra** fit into the **three-tier architecture** (Model / View / Controller)  
- Managing **application state** in a web-based environment  
- Using **service-oriented architecture (SOA)** by connecting to external APIs  
- Getting hands-on experience deploying to **Heroku**

In short — this was about **writing disciplined code**, not just code that “works.”

## The Process 🔄

The ESaaS agile workflow goes something like this:

1. Talk to the customer or define the user story  
2. Write acceptance tests using **Cucumber** (behavior-driven development)  
3. Use **RSpec** to write unit tests for game logic  
4. Build just enough code to make those tests pass  
5. Expose that logic as a **Sinatra** web app  
6. Deploy and iterate — fast

In the full cycle, you’d write your own RSpec and Cucumber tests from scratch.  
For this assignment, the scaffolding was provided — letting me focus on understanding the flow, writing clean code, and making the tests go green ✅.
